# Process Visualisation and Editor
using ES6 and [dagre](https://github.com/dagrejs/dagre)

# Installation
We use [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) with [babel](https://babeljs.io/) to translate ES6 to JavaScript that IE understands.

1. Install node.js (if its not even installed, e.g. by meteor).
1. Type `npm install` to install webpack and other required libraries.
1. run `npm run dist` to build the library (it will be build in dist/).
1. open test_light_theme.htm in your browser.
